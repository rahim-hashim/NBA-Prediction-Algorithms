In other scripts within this directory, we will be using the data captured here to run analyses that will help the average user ask both broad and specific questions related to the NBA. We will probe on what statistics and criteria are important for an NBA team to win an NBA championship, how the league has evolved year-over-year, touch on the GOAT debate, and ultimately, build algorithms that can (hopefully) help us all beat Vegas lines consistently so that we can all retire from our day jobs and gamble on the NBA for the rest of our careers. \n","\n","None of this could have been done without the tireless and comprehensive effort of those who work at [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) providing an open-source, API-friendly database containing millions of datapoints from which the entirety of this codebase is built. \n","\n","For any questions/concerns, feel free to reach out to me directly at rahim.hashim@columbia.edu. And in the case that this is useful to anyone for future projects, please give credit where credit is due, both to [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) and myself.
